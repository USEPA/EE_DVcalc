This tool allows state, local, and tribal air monitoring agencies to determine the regulatory significance (i.e. whether excluding concentrations affected by exceptional events will affect attainment of the NAAQS) of ozone and PM2.5 concentrations impacted by exceptional events by calculating the impact of excluding these concentrations on the design value, the statistic used to determine whether an ambient air quality monitoring site is meeting the NAAQS.
